She navigated the narrow ledges, a furry tightrope walker, her whiskers twitching with every new scent: exhaust fumes, hot dogs, a tantalizing whiff of fish.\n\nHer adventure took her through a hidden alleyway, where she befriended a scruffy, one-eared tomcat named Rusty who, with a knowing wink, told her tales of a legendary \"Green Oasis\" just beyond the city limits.\n\nThe Green Oasis! The very words hummed with promise. It was said to be a place where birds sang the sweetest melodies, mice practically lined up to be chased, and the catnip grew taller than a cat himself.\n\nRusty, however, was too set in his alleyway ways to join her. So, with a farewell lick on his ear, Clementine ventured forth, following the faint scent of damp earth and pine.\n\nThe journey was fraught with peril. She narrowly avoided being squashed by a rogue skateboarder, outsmarted a particularly persistent pigeon, and even had a brief but tense standoff with a chihuahua the size of her head.\n\nFinally, after what felt like a lifetime, Clementine saw it: a verdant patch of green peeking through the concrete jungle. Her heart leaped with joy.\n\nThe Green Oasis wasn't exactly what she'd imagined. It was a small, overgrown park, tucked away behind a crumbling warehouse. But it was green. And it was brimming with life. Butterflies danced around her, a robin serenaded her from a branch, and yes, there was a patch of catnip, not quite taller than her, but certainly robust.\n\nClementine spent the afternoon basking in the dappled sunlight, chasing butterflies, and indulging in the potent catnip. It wasn't exactly the wild adventure she'd envisioned, but it was perfect. It was hers.\n\nAs dusk painted the sky in hues of orange and purple, a pang of guilt tugged at her. Her humans would be worried. Maybe the apartment wasn't so bad after all.\n\nMaking her way back was easier, the city somehow less daunting. She slipped back through the window just as her humans were opening the door, panicked looks on their faces.\n\nThey scooped her up in a flurry of hugs and relieved coos. Clementine purred, nuzzling into their arms. The apartment, with its soft blankets and familiar smells, felt good.\n\nBut as she drifted off to sleep, her head filled with images of butterflies and green leaves, Clementine knew one thing for sure: this was just the beginning of her adventures. The city held countless secrets, waiting to be discovered. And she, Clementine, the tabby with a thirst for the unknown, was ready to find them. Her paw twitched in her sleep, already planning her next grand escape.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

As a result, the Flash Thinking model is capable of stronger reasoning capabilities in its responses.\n\nUsing a \"thinking mode\" model can provide you with high-quality responses without needing specialised prompting like the previous approaches. One reason this technique is effective is that you induce the model to generate relevant information (\"brainstorming\", or \"thoughts\") that is then used as part of the context in which the final response is generated.\n\nNote that when you use the API, you get the final response from the model, but the thoughts are not captured. To see the intermediate thoughts, try out [the thinking mode model in AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21).\n\n<table align=left>\n  <td>\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1Z991SV7lZZZqioOiqIUPv9a9ix-ws4zk\"><img src=\"https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png\" style=\"height: 24px\" height=24/> Open in AI Studio</a>\n  </td>\n</table>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import io\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown, clear_output\n\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content_stream(\n    model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp',\n    contents='Who was the youngest author listed on the transformers NLP paper?',\n)\n\nbuf = io.StringIO()\nfor chunk in response:\n    buf.write(chunk.text)\n    # Display the response as it is streamed\n    print(chunk.text, end='')\n\n# And then render the finished response as formatted markdown.\nclear_output()\nMarkdown(buf.getvalue())","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-10T08:49:07.811630Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-10T08:49:07.811940Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-10T08:49:28.392084Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-10T08:49:07.811907Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-10T08:49:28.391173Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":27,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"It's tricky to definitively say who the *absolute youngest* author was on the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper (which is likely the \"transformers NLP paper\" you're referring to, as it introduced the Transformer architecture).\n\nHere's why it's difficult and what we can infer:\n\n* **Age is generally not public information for researchers.**  Birthdates and exact ages are not typically listed in papers or public profiles.\n* **\"Youngest\" can be interpreted in different ways:**  Do you mean youngest in terms of chronological age, or youngest in terms of career stage/experience at the time of publication?\n\n**What we *can* do is look at publicly available information and make some educated guesses, but it will be speculative.**\n\n**Authors of \"Attention is All You Need\" (2017):**\n\n* Ashish Vaswani\n* Noam Shazeer\n* Niki Parmar\n* Jakob Uszkoreit\n* Llion Jones\n* Aidan N. Gomez\n* Łukasz Kaiser\n* Illia Polosukhin\n\n**Possible Approaches to Guessing (with caveats):**\n\n* **Look at current affiliations and roles:**  Sometimes, current roles can hint at career stage progression.  For example, someone who is now a professor might have been further along in their career in 2017 than someone who was a PhD student at the time.  However, this is not always reliable.\n* **Check for online profiles (LinkedIn, personal websites):**  These might give hints about their career history and when they started in research.\n* **Look for mentions of their academic status at the time:**  Did any of the authors mention being a PhD student or intern during that period in interviews or online profiles?\n\n**Likely Candidates for \"Youngest\" (Speculative):**\n\nBased on general career progression in academia and often starting research earlier, **Aidan N. Gomez** is a possible candidate for being the youngest author at the time of publication.  He was often associated with the University of Oxford during that period, which could suggest he was earlier in his academic career compared to some of the authors from Google Brain.\n\n**However, this is purely speculative and based on very limited public information.**  It's impossible to say for sure who was the *chronologically* youngest without knowing their birthdates.\n\n**In conclusion, we cannot definitively say who the youngest author was.  It's likely either Aidan N. Gomez or possibly another author who was earlier in their research career at the time, but without more specific information, it remains speculation.**\n\nIf you have a specific reason for needing to know this, or if you come across information about the authors' ages at the time of publication, please feel free to share, and I can try to refine the answer."},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Code prompting","metadata":{"id":"jPiZ_eIIaVPt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Generating code\n\nThe Gemini family of models can be used to generate code, configuration and scripts.

You can quickly see if you have changes to commit, if you're on the right branch, and if you need to pull or push changes.\n    *   **Improved workflow:**  By providing this information directly in the prompt, it reduces the need to constantly run `git status` to check the state of your repository.  This speeds up your development workflow.\n    *   **Customization:** The script is highly customizable. You can modify the colors, symbols, and information displayed to fit your preferences.  It supports themes to quickly change the look and feel.\n    *   **Virtual environment awareness:** It also integrates with virtual environments, displaying the active environment in the prompt.\n\nIn essence, this script is a productivity tool that integrates Git status directly into your shell prompt, saving you time and making you more aware of your repository's state.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":31}]}
