  2. [Explore](https://github.com/helloboyn/GenAI-Workout/blob/main/GenAI-Kaggle/embeddings-and-similarity-scores.ipynb) text similarity with embeddings.
  3. [Build](https://github.com/helloboyn/GenAI-Workout/blob/main/GenAI-Kaggle/classifying-embeddings-with-keras.ipynb) a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings.


- Today, you'll dive into the foundational concepts behind embeddings and vector databases, and discover how they can integrate real-time or specialized data into your LLM-based application. You'll also examine their geometric capabilities for classifying and comparing text, along with methods for evaluating embeddings.
